# Kickstarter Outcomes

## Perform Analysis on Kickstarter to Uncover Trends

### Focused on Theater Data Concerning Successful, Failed and Cancelled Kickstarters  

##  Prepared Pivot Tables from Data Set with the extracted information pertaining to Theater or Plays. Created Line Charts to visually display and compare Successful, Failed and Canceled Kickstarters focusing on Goals and Launch Date. 
  
### In 12 months 1369 Kickstarters were created. 839 were Successful with most success being acheived in May followed by June then July. However, the most failed coincide with these months, leading me to surmise that these months had the most in totallity of Kickstarter launches and additionaly May, June and July are the cost common months to launch a Kickstarter.     

### The Kickstarters with Goals under $5000 found to be the most successful with appoximetly 74% success rate. Additionaly, those with goals between $5000 and $25000 had about a 50/50% chance of success. Seemingly, Kickstarters with smaller goals are achieved most often.
 
### Some challenges I had, Converting the Years from  Launch Date Data to Months in the Pivot Table. Second, working in the Outcomes Based on Goals, the columns totaled all Subcatergories from the Data Set eventhough I had a filter applied for Plays. Eventually realized I must add "Plays" to my Countifs formula. That solved the problem.

## Results

 -  Kickstarters with Launches in May, Jun and July are most successful, however they see most failure also, due to these being the months that have the most number of     Kickstarters launched.

- Kickstarters with goals under $5000 are most successful. 

- Limitation I found with this data set is, it is lacking identification for what the money is to be used for, therefore not sure that all Kickstarters are equal.

- A Bar Chart would work well in the Outcomes by Launch Date. Additionally a Sunburst or Pie Chart would be pleasing to the eye for the Goals.
